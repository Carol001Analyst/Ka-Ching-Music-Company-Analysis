Here's some observations from the company’s information.
1.	1970 was the best year for Ka’Ching in terms of albums sold for all their artists.
2.	All artists brought in approximately $7.8 billion in revenue over the period of 1955 and 2011.
3.	The Rolling Stones was their top performing artist or band as they brought in highest revenue over the given period of time.
4.	Rock was hands down, the best-selling genre followed by funk/soul. Then hiphop was the third best.
5.	For the sub-genres, blues rock, electric blues, and the harmonica blues performed the most poorly in terms of sales made.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.	Ka'Ching Company should review what they might have done differently with their artists in year 1970, which might have resulted in more albums being sold than the rest of the years. If they exercised maybe more active advertising, more artist tours, and album discounts, they can then replicate more of that going forward. 
2.	The company could also assess how they managed The Rolling Stones band over time and practise the same for their other artists. They could even try to see if the band could share what they do differently to emerge as the customers' favorites.
3.	Rock being the best-selling genre, the company should encourage more artists to produce more of this genre, but with a touch of the artist's taste and style.
4.	The company should conduct a survey and gain insight as to why these sub-genres performed very poorly compared to the rest. If customers do not know or understand such sub-genres clearly, the company could aim at marketing it more and encourage artists to produce such songs with better and spicier melodies to attract more customers.
If this doesn't work, the company could consider reducing production and management of music related with these sub-genres.
5.	All these recommendations could assist Ka'Ching Company to make strategic decisions with regards to their artists, thereby increasing their revenue from $7.8 billion to even much higher
